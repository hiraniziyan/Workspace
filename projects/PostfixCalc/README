GOAL: this program acts a a postfix calculator which can solve mathematical problems entered in the postfix order of a binary expression tree

input-output: All input must be in postfix order, and the commands for output show the information stored in the top slot of the stack, or the entire stack

The stack.h file contains the declarations for all objects, constructors, and  methods in the stack.cpp class.
public:
	Stack() - a stack contructor with capacity 30 as a parameter
	
	methods:
	bool isEmpty() const, bool isFull() const, Object & top(), void makeEmpty(), void pop(), void push(), Object topAndPop();

private: 
	theArray - vector/array of objects
	topOfStack - int datafield for location of top in Array

dsexceptions.h - gives declarations to errors
	UnderFlow{}
	OverFlow{}
	DivisionByZero{}
	DataError{}

stack.cpp implements the constructors and methods in the stack class 		//the class uses templates so the stack can be any object type
	- Stack(int capacity) : theArray(capacity) --- constructor for the stack; intiializes the topOfStack to -1;
	- bool isEmpty() const --- returns a true if stack is empty by checking if topOfStack is -1, else returns false
	- bool isFull() const --- returns a true if stack is full by checking if topOfStack is size of the array - 1, else return false
	- void makeEmpty() --- makes the stack empty by setting the topOfStack to -1
	- top() const --- if stack is empty it throws and underflow error, else it returns the value most recently inserted and stack remains unchanged
	- pop() --- if stack is empty it throws and underflow error, else it removes most recently inserted item and makes topOfStack point to the slot before the deleted top
	- push (const Object & x) --- inserts x into stack and makes topOfStack point at that slot if stack is not full, otherwise throw an overflow error
	- topAndPop() --- if stack is empty it throws and underflow error, else returns the value at the topOfStack and deletes it from stack 

client program dc.cpp
	- main method --- declares a stack of integers and takes in user input in an infinite while loop until user ends program
	- runCalculator() --- takes in the stack and input line as parameters
		- goes through the entire string one character at a time 

		-if the character is a digit or underscore(signifies a negative), keep going until the next character is not a digit and append the character onto a string
		-convert the string of digits to an integer using atoi() and pushes it into a stack (if the string has a '_' at index 0, take a substring to remove the '_' and multiply the value by -1)
		-if the stack if full this is in a try-catch block, so it will give an overflow message

		-if the character is not a digit, send it through to the check command method
	- checkCommand() --- takes in stack parameter and char parameter sent in from runCalculator method;
		-checks the command in a switch statement
		' ' -> skip over empty space
		'p' -> print the top of stack using top() method; new line is printed after
		'n' -> prints and pops the top using the topAndPop() method; does not print new line
		'c' -> clears stack using the makeEmpty() method; 
		'f' -> calls the printStack() method
			-printStack() takes in stack parameter which is not pass by reference so it copies the stack;
				-goes through a while loop and prints and pops the top until stack is empty using topAndPop(); new line is printed after each value
		'r' -> calls reverse() method
			-reverse() takes in stack parameter
			-gets the top two numbers using topAndPop() and pushes them back in but in reverse order
		'd' -> duplicates the top of the stack by pushes the top back onto top using push() and top()
		'+', '-', *', '/', '%'-> calls methods add, subtract, multiply, divide, and remainder respectively
			- these methods take in stack as a parameter and get the top two integers in the stack and pops them using topAndPop()
			- then it adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides, or gets the remainder of the two numbers respectively and pushes value onto stack using push()
			- the order of the arithmetic (second top, operation, top) // this is important in subtration, division, and remainder calculation
			- the divide and remainder methods contain a try-catch which throws a divisionByZero error in case division by zero occurs and the stacks remain unchanged
		'!' -> calls factorial method
			- gets the top value and pops it using topAndPop()
			- if the top is negative, give error message
			- else if it is zero, push 1 onto stack
			- else declare a variable to store the result and use a for loop with variable i which iterates until i <= top of stack and multiply the result by i at each iteration.
			- pushes result to top of stack using push()
		'^' -> calls power method
			-takes the top two values of the stack and pops them using topAndPop (the first is the exponent and second is the base)
			-does not support negative powers, so it shows error message if exponent is negative
			-raises base to the exponent power by using pow() and pushes it onto stack using push()
			- the order of the arithmetic (second top, operation, top) 
		default -> throws DataException if the character does not match any commands
	- the switch statement is in a try-catch block which catches DataException, OverFlow, and UnderFlow.

	- after one command is run it goes back to the runCalculator method for next command until end of input
	- the program goes back to the main method to repeat all steps until the user hits ctrl-d to end program.
