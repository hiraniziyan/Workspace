Create a program that stores employees in a database by:

1) displayCommands for the user to add/download/upload/search/etc... employees
2) runDatabase by prompting user for command and going through switch statement to execute commands on 3-9
3) addEmployee by asking user for employee info and storing and sorting it in arraylist
	- bubble sorting algorithm used for sorting
4) raiseWage which increases pay by percentage
	-uses increaseWage method of Employee class
5) computePayChecks which asks for hours worked and computed pay based on that
	-uses get and computePay methods of HourlyEmployee and SalariedEmployee clases
6) printRecords of employee based on a certain location
	-uses get and toString methods of the Hourly and SalariedEmployee classes
7) downloadData downloads all employee information for each employee currently in arrayList and stores it in a Binary file
   named Employee.dat
8) uploadData which prints out all of the records of the employees which were previously uploaded in the binary file
9) searchList which searches for particular employee using binary search and prints out records

classes
Parent class - Employee
 - contains constructor with name and wage to be used for child classes
 - contains getters and setters for name and wage 
 - increase wage method to increase pay by percent
 - abstract computPay method and formatting methods for child classes

HourlyEmployee class extends Employee
- contains contructor which accesses parent contructor for name and wage
- fills out computePay and gives bonus for extra hours
- contains toString

SalariedEmployee class extends Employee
- contains constructor which sends in name and salary/40/52
- contains getters and setters for salary
- computePay which always returns 1/52 * salary regardless of hours worked
- contains toString
