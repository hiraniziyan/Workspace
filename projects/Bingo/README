Create a BINGO program which:

1) takes in values from a file to make BINGO card
	- file is in row major order with 25 rows and 2 integers on each row (1 per person)
	-for loop to read file numers into 2-D array

2) generates random numbers as drawings
	- Math.random()*75 + 1

3) checks for a duplicate pick
	-BitSet with 75 elements, so if a number is picked, the BitSet of the number will be changed to true

4) marks of picked numbers
	-check the location of the random number in array and set to 0, and when printing card, change 0 to "X"

5) checks for win
	- do for loops for each column, row, and diagonal, and if the sum of the elements is 0, declare win and the type
	- checks who won

OUTPUT:

1) Prints each players bingo card
2) Prints the generated random numbers
3) Prints who won, what kind of win, and in how many turns
4) Prints the players cards
